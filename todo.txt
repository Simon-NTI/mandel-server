Replace all buffer -> view -> view.setBigUint64 with a function
Make verbose debugging an option, make runtime diagnostics more compact and readable
Flush the output folder from all files except final.bmp
Add a timer to measure elapsed time
- Add timestamps for when a task was started, when a task ended and when a fragment was recieved
Migrate from bigint?, a lot of unnecessary code and type casting is needed which adds complexity, find a better solution
Find a way of tracking clients, i.e which clients are connected and which fragments have been sent to which client

?? Find a better way of "trapping" clients waiting for a new fragment ??
?? Rename final.bmp to {timestamp}.bmp ?? or maybe final_{timestamp}.bmp
